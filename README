How to compile and run the simulator
------------------------------------
1. Follow the given steps to compile Iris
    ./configure
    make

2. Run the simulator
There are three different binaries 
    - manifold_simMC: 
        this runs a standalone version of the memory controller simulator and takes as many traces as the number of the threads.
        ./manifold_simMC <trace1> <trace2>
        ./manifold_simMC traces/perl_3254.tr traces/perl_3254.tr

   - manifold_simIris: 
        this runs an integrated network and memory model with currently the mesh topology.
        ./manifold_simIris config/generic.cfg

   - manifold_fullSim: 
        this runs the full system with zesto->network->MC. Currently only supports meshes of small sizes.
        - TODO: DHRUV FILL IN SAMPLE

The following switches are supported at the command line in the current version
    --thread_id_bits, --mc_bits --early_credit
