/* The following macros are used to pretty similarly to regular fatal and assert
   calls, with the exception that when *not* in DEBUG mode, the failure does not
   immediately terminate the program.  Instead, the retval argument is immediately
   returned by the enclosing function, and the oracle's hosed bit is set.  Upon
   detecting that it is hosed, the oracle will attempt to flush the pipeline and
   then restore the state of the processor.  This allows you to still get results
   even when you haven't debugged every last corner case.  Make sure you check the
   number of emergency recoveries in the simulator's output stats; if this number is
   small relative to the number of total simulated cycles, then your bug probably
   won't have much statistically significant impact on your results.  If it's a
   large number, then go fix your bug(s)! */
