/* (See get_uop_array/return_uop_array functions)
   The following struct and the functions after that are for
   implementing our own "malloc/free" for the uop arrays.  The
   original Mop_t implementation contained a static uop_t array
   sized for the worst-case flow, which caused the Mop_t struct to
   be very large and unwieldly.

   The outside world just wants a struct uop_t *, but
   uop_array_pool has additional fields (namely the size and a
   pointer for chaining all of the free entries together).  This
   unfortunately means that when you return the struct uop_t * to
   the free pool we have to do some ugly pointer munging to get the
   address of the overall uop_array_pool struct.  However, you'll
   be fine if you just use the interface functions, and you
   probably don't even need to do that. */
